            <h1>Cooking at Altitude</h1>
            <p>When you move to a higher altitude, the boiling point of water drops, due to the lower pressure. This has a profound effect on cooking! Read on to discover the adaptations you'll need to make at high altitude.</p>

                <h1>Mass vs. Altitude</h1>
                <p>The relationship between the amount of air there is and the altitude is a question of gravity. Atmospheric particles of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen are held to the Earth because of gravity. The farther from the center of the Earth you move, the fewer atmospheric particles you'll find. Move the altitude slider in the demo to check it out!</p>
                <p><b>Math note:</b> because attraction due to gravity varies inversely with r<sup>2</sup>, the number of particles decreases at a decreasing rate as you climb in altitude.</p>

                <h1>Pressure vs. Mass</h1>
                <p>So now that we know that the amount of air decreases as you move up, the relationship between mass and pressure can be explained. At a constant temperature and volume, a decrease in the amount of air you have creates a decrease in pressure. This is animated to the right.</p>
                <p>Putting these two relationships together, one can see that the air pressure decreases as you move higher in altitude. But what does this have to do with cooking? To explain that, we'll need to define <em>boiling</em>.</p>

                <h1>Boiling</h1>
                <p>The <em>boiling point</em> of a liquid is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the pressure of the atmosphere around the liquid. At this point, liquid particles will break off the surface of the liquid and turn into vapor more quickly than the vapor around it turns back into liquid.</p>
                <p>When the pressure of the gas surrounding a liquid is lower, less heat needs to be added to the liquid to reach the boiling point. In effect, this means that water boils at a lower temperature in high altitude situations. While we know water to boil at 100&deg;C at sea level, it boils at 98&deg;C at 2000 feet.</p>

                <h1>Cooking</h1>
                <p>So, what does this all mean? For one thing, it means that any boiled foods, like spaghetti or potatoes, will take longer to cook. This doesn't make sense at first, because a lower boiling point corresponds to a shorter time to boil the water, right&#8253;&#8253; This is true, but a lower boiling point also means that the food takes longer to cook at this lower temperature. You may need to add a few minutes to these cooking times. Charles Darwin said of this effect:</p>
                <blockquote>The elevation was probably not under 11,000 feet... At the place where we slept water necessarily boiled, from the diminished pressure of the atmosphere, at a lower temperature than it does in a less lofty country... Hence the potatoes, after remaining for some hours in the boiling water, were nearly as hard as ever.</blockquote>
